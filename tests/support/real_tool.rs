//! Shared real-tool lifecycle runner.
//!
//! Every real CLI (Codex, Claude, ...) is driven through ONE lifecycle here, so
//! the test asserts a single tool-independent contract: launch → bind → file
//! tool → shell tool → `hcom send` → transcript → idle inbound delivery → live
//! fork → kill parent → resume → cleanup + request audit. Tools that meet the
//! contract by different mechanisms (Codex's native fork vs Claude's
//! `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` session-UUID recovery) are NOT special-cased: the shared
//! fork assertion (`child.session_id != parent.session_id`, both alive, child
//! transcript ⊇ parent history + fork proof, parent ⊉ fork proof) is exactly
//! what proves either mechanism, and regression-guards Claude's workaround for
//! free. A per-tool fork assertion would be checking the mechanism instead of
//! the contract.
//!
//! The only per-tool code is the [`ToolCase`] seam: wire codec + latest-turn
//! classification ([`ToolCase::respond`]), version pin, launch args/env, config
//! routing, and a couple of capability strings. Everything else lives here.
